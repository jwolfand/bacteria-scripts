# sw-log-removal-model
This is a repository for scripts for a stormwater BMP log removal model.
bacteria_removal_model.R is the main script 

The code uses the Ballona Creek watershed as a case study to look at a variety of stormwater best management practices (BMPs) and their pollutant removal at the watershed scale. In this case, I look at fecal indicator bacteria removal (FIB). 

The code is available here for your reference, but unfortunately I cannot provide support for its use.
